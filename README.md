# Learn-Javascript

## SETUP (Read First)

1) Ensure you have Google Chrome installed, with developer tools enabled. You can check this by pressing F12 on Windows or Option + ⌘ + I on Mac, and a toolbar should open listing all the elements on the webpage.

2) Install Node.js

3) Install Visual Studio Code, or any other code editor that you are comfortable using.

4) Clone this repository onto your local machine.

5) Read the Overview section of the README.md

6) Open "Module 1 - Introduction to JavaScript" and begin reading "module_1.md"

## Overview

Welcome to a crash course in Javascript! This course will be structured in a series of modules/folders, each designed to introduce you to a fundamental aspect of JavaScript. Each module will contain a text file, guiding you through each lesson, as well as various other JavaScript files with tasks to complete. The focus of this course is to teach JavaScript, so all html and css files should be left as-is. JavaScript files, however, are fair game and should be changed and altered to complete the tasks and challenges set forth. By the end of the course, you should feel comfortable with the following key concepts and fundamentals of JavaScript:

1) Syntax and Fundamentals: You'll be proficient in writing JavaScript code, understanding its syntax, variables, data types, operators, and control structures like loops and conditionals.

2) Functions and Objects: You'll grasp the concept of functions in JavaScript, how to define and call them, work with parameters and return values. Additionally, you'll be familiar with JavaScript's object-oriented features, including creating objects, defining methods, and using constructors.

3) DOM Manipulation: You'll understand how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to dynamically update and interact with HTML and CSS on web pages.

4) Event Handling: You'll be able to respond to user actions and events such as clicks, keystrokes, and form submissions using event listeners and handlers.

5) Asynchronous Programming: You'll have a basic understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, including callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax, allowing you to work effectively with asynchronous operations like fetching data from APIs.

6) Error Handling and Debugging: You'll know how to handle errors gracefully in JavaScript code and use debugging techniques and tools to identify and fix issues.

7) Basic Interactivity and Validation: You'll be able to create interactive elements on web pages, validate user input, and enhance user experience through client-side scripting.

8) Basic Project Implementation: You'll have practical experience implementing small JavaScript projects, which may include interactive forms, simple games, or dynamic content updates.

Overall, the goal is for you to feel confident in your ability to write, understand, and debug JavaScript code. This is not a course in any software or testing processes that utilize JavaScript and will therefore not cover anything of that nature, but you should be prepared with the fundamental skills you need to tackle any JavaScript-related challenge following the conclusion of this course.
