// KNOWLEDGE CHECK - Can you answer these questions?
// 1) What is a function call?
// 2) If a variable has local scope, what part of the file can and cannot access that variable?
// 3) What is the primary advantage of using an arrow function?

// Practice Problems:
// TODO: Write a function called "temperatureConverter" that takes two parameters: an integer named "temperature" representing the starting temperature, and a boolean named "fahrenheitToCelsius"
// If fahrenheitToCelsius is true, assume temperature is in fahrenheit and return the temperature converted into celsius,
// Else assume temperature is in celsius and return the temperature converted into fahrenheit



// TODO: Write an ARROW function that returns if a number is divisible by 10



// TODO: Write two functions that use asnyc and await to fetch data from an API at the same time (Check out https://dummyapi.online/ for some URLs to put in fetch() )



// KNOWLEDGE CHECK - Answers:
// 1) A function call is an expression that executes a block of code (the function), optionally passing arguments.
// 2) The function that the variable is contained in can access the variable, any code outside the function cannot access the variable.
// 3) Arrow functions provide concise, neat syntax, making them ideal for writing small functions.
