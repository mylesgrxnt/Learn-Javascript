// Practice Problems:
// TODO: Write a function called "temperatureConverter" that takes two parameters: an integer named "temperature" representing the starting temperature, and a boolean named "fahrenheitToCelsius"
// If fahrenheitToCelsius is true, assume temperature is in fahrenheit and return the temperature converted into celsius,
// Else assume temperature is in celsius and return the temperature converted into fahrenheit



// TODO: Write an ARROW function that returns if a number is divisible by 10



// TODO: Write two functions that use asnyc and await to fetch data from an API at the same time (Check out https://dummyapi.online/ for some URLs to put in fetch() )
