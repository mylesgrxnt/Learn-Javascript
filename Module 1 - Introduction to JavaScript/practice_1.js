// KNOWLEDGE CHECK - Can you answer these questions?
// 1) What are the 5 primitive data types discussed?
// 2) What are the 3 types of variables?
// 3) What are the 3 components of a for loop and how does a for loop operate?

// KNOWLEDGE CHECK - Answers:
// 1) Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null.
// 2) var, let, const.
// 3) initialization, condition, afterthought. Check module_1.md to recap the steps of a for loop!
// 4) A wihle loop checks the condition before executing the block statement, whereas the do while loop executes the block statement before checking the condition.
